# Neighborhood Highlighter Map 

Google map based application that outlines Neighborhoods in various cities. For users new to a city and looking to explore all the city has to offer (especially those outside of tourist areas), this app can help them take a neighborhood based approach to their exploration. It allows users to see which neighborhood they are currently in and make note of any highlight relating to that neighborhood. Currently, the app outlines neighborhoods in Chicago and New York only.

App is hosted on pivotal cloud foundry and can be accessed at
